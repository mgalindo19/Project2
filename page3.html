    <h1>Chicago Bulls</h1>
    <p>The Chicago Bulls were very important to me and to other Chicagoans who loved basketball. But when talking about the Bulls, most people only think of the amazing player Michael Jordan — you can’t forget about Derrick Rose.</p>

    <h1>Derrick Rose</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>One of the best Bulls players of all time.</li>
      <li>The youngest MVP — not just for the Bulls, but in the entire NBA.</li>
      <li>Led the team to a 62-20 record in the regular season, the best since the Jordan era.</li>
      <li>First Bulls player to win the MVP award since Jordan.</li>
      <li>Unlike Jordan, D-Rose was born and raised in Chicago.</li>
      <li>D-Rose gave insperation the kids of Chicago and allowed the city to have a new beacon of hope for the youth of Chicago.</li>
    </ul>
