    <h1>Welcome to My Home Page!</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Miguel Galindo. This website is a simple HTML project with some css that includes my resume and a page about one of my hobbies â€” Video Gmaes. I am currently studying computer science and cybersecurity, and I enjoy learning how technology works.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a student at Illinois Institute of Technology as a freshman. I love playing video games and listening to music. But there is one thing I can't live without, and that is music. One of my favorite artists is Juice WRLD. I would consider him the best musician of this generation.</p>

    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Technology and cybersecurity</li>
      <li>Music and playing video games</li>
      <li>Walking my dogs</li>
    </ul>
